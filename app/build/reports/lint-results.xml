        message="Invalid package reference in library; not included in Android: `javax.script`. Referenced from `org.luaj.vm2.script.LuaScriptEngine`."

        summary="Package not included in Android"
        explanation="This check scans through libraries looking for calls to APIs that are not included in Android.&#xA;&#xA;When you create Android projects, the classpath is set up such that you can only access classes in the API packages that are included in Android. However, if you add other projects to your libs/ folder, there is no guarantee that those .jar files were built with an Android specific classpath, and in particular, they could be accessing unsupported APIs such as java.applet.&#xA;&#xA;This check scans through library jars and looks for references to API packages that are not included in Android and flags these. This is only an error if your code calls one of the library classes which wind up referencing the unsupported package.">

        id="AllowBackup"
        severity="Warning"
        message="On SDK version 23 and up, your app data will be automatically backed up and restored on app install. Consider adding the attribute `android:fullBackupContent` to specify an `@xml` resource which configures which files to backup. More info: https://developer.android.com/training/backup/autosyncapi.html"
        category="Security"
        priority="3"
        summary="AllowBackup/FullBackupContent Problems"
        explanation="The `allowBackup` attribute determines if an application&apos;s data can be backed up and restored. It is documented at http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#allowBackup&#xA;&#xA;By default, this flag is set to `true`. When this flag is set to `true`, application data can be backed up and restored by the user using `adb backup` and `adb restore`.&#xA;&#xA;This may have security consequences for an application. `adb backup` allows users who have enabled USB debugging to copy application data off of the device. Once backed up, all application data can be read by the user. `adb restore` allows creation of application data from a source specified by the user. Following a restore, applications should not assume that the data, file permissions, and directory permissions were created by the application itself.&#xA;&#xA;Setting `allowBackup=&quot;false&quot;` opts an application out of both backup and restore.&#xA;&#xA;To fix this warning, decide whether your application should support backup, and explicitly set `android:allowBackup=(true|false)&quot;`.&#xA;&#xA;If not set to false, and if targeting API 23 or later, lint will also warn that you should set `android:fullBackupContent` to configure auto backup."

If you want to include resources that are only referenced from tests, consider packaging them in a test source set instead.&#xA;&#xA;You can include test sources in the unused resource check by setting the system property lint.unused-resources.include-tests=true, and to exclude them (usually for performance reasons), use lint.unused-resources.exclude-tests=true."
